# Intro Angular 2
### AngularJS
* Not dead (yet).
* Still being actively developed and supported
* Shut off for support will happen when the metrics drop off significantly (not necessarily soon)

### Angular 2
* Actively developed
* Main ng team efforts
* Uses [TypeScript, ES6 ... or ES5/Dart...don't]

### High Level Angular 2
* Modules
  * es6 components encapsulation
  * ng2 containers single responsibility
* Components
  * building blocks (replaced controllers)
* Decorators
  * Provides ng metadata about the class (basically the exact same as Spring annotations)
  * ES6/TypeScript support (will support) decorators...browsers will eventually once it is formally added to ES6 spec
* Dependency Injection
  * Opportunities to override DI configuration at the component/provider level
* Services (simplified)
  * now just `Service` -> *`@Injectable`*
* Data Binding
  * Improved performance and simplified code (...about 3 things to know now...)
* Performance
  * Faster...wicked fast
